# frontpage
## What is this?

This repo contains a snapshot of data captured from the freerepublic.com front
page. The data is captured as a timeseries. You can explore the dataset by using
the `frontpage.ipynb` file, or accessing the data directly in the
`data/frontpage.csv` file.

Other sidebars, like "Breaking News", are not included in the dataset.

In the spirit of quarterly freepathons the data will be rolled over each
quarter and tagged. If you want previous quarter's data check for the relevant
tag.

## Why?

Discussion on the site is often facilitated by sharing links from other websites.
The dataset contains information about when a particular link was prominent on
the front page.
